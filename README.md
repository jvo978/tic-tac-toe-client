AS A USER, I want to sign up, so I can play this game

-Start out by trying to to connect with the API
-Added sign-up.sh to curl-scripts folder
-Tested curl-script inside terminal to see if it worked // worked user id was made
-Made a form tag with an id that wraps three inputs elements for signing up in index.html.
-Tested my form submit function by console logging it with text in index.js. It works, but the text disappears and page refreshes.
-Made a file in scripts called events.js for event outcome.
-Required my events.js in index.js
-Updated development and production API URL to config.js
-Required getFormFields from lib folder to grab data from the form when user hits submit on sign up.
- Made api file that holds the function request made my user to sign up.
- This then triggers whether outcome was a success or failure.
